    question: 'Are your pest control treatments safe for children and pets?',
    answer: 'Yes, our treatments are designed with family safety in mind. We use targeted application methods and select products that are EPA-approved for residential use. We will provide specific safety instructions for each treatment, including any waiting periods before re-entry. For households with children, pets, or specific health concerns, we offer green treatment options that use reduced-risk or botanical ingredients.'

    question: 'How soon can you schedule a pest control appointment?',
    answer: 'For standard appointments, we typically offer service within 2-3 business days. For urgent situations like rodent infestations or aggressive stinging insects, we offer same-day or next-day emergency service in most areas. You can check availability and schedule online or call our office for the most current scheduling options.'

    question: 'Do I need to prepare my home before a pest control treatment?',
    answer: 'Some preparation is typically required for effective treatment. We will provide specific instructions based on the pest and treatment method, but common preparations include: clearing items from certain areas, securing food items, ensuring pets are temporarily relocated, and addressing any specific access needs. For comprehensive treatments like bed bug heat remediation, more extensive preparation may be necessary.'

    question: 'How long will it take to eliminate my pest problem?',
    answer: 'Resolution time varies depending on the pest species, infestation level, and property characteristics. Some issues like individual wasp nests can be resolved in a single visit, while German cockroach or bed bug infestations typically require 2-3 treatments over several weeks. During your inspection, we will provide a specific timeline and treatment plan for your situation.'

    question: 'Do you offer warranties or guarantees on your pest control services?',
    answer: 'Yes, we stand behind our work with service guarantees. Most of our treatments include a 30-90 day warranty period during which we will return at no additional cost if pest activity continues. Our annual protection plans include unlimited service calls for covered pests. Some specialized services like termite control come with extended warranties of up to 5 years with annual inspection maintenance.'

  {
    question: 'What\'s the difference between your one-time treatments and recurring service plans?',
    answer: 'One-time treatments target a specific active pest problem with a customized approach for that particular situation. Our recurring service plans provide both corrective treatments and preventative maintenance to address current issues and prevent future infestations. Recurring plans typically include a perimeter treatment of your home, regular inspections, unlimited service calls for covered pests, and discounts on additional services.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer eco-friendly or organic pest control options?',
    answer: 'Yes, we offer green pest control options that utilize botanical-based products, reduced-risk pesticides, and integrated pest management approaches that minimize chemical use. These services focus on prevention, exclusion, habitat modification, and targeted application methods. While our conventional treatments are also applied with safety in mind, our green options provide additional peace of mind for environmentally-conscious customers or those with specific health concerns.'

  {
    question: 'How can I prevent pests from returning after treatment?',
    answer: 'After treatment, we will provide customized prevention recommendations for your property. Common preventative measures include: sealing entry points around plumbing and utility penetrations, maintaining a clean environment with proper food storage, reducing moisture issues, keeping vegetation trimmed away from the home, and proper waste management. Our recurring service plans also provide ongoing prevention through regular treatments and inspections.'
